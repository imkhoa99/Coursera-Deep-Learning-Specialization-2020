# Coursera Deep Learning Specialization 2020

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Introduction
This repository contains all my work for this specialization. All the codes, quiz questions, screenshot, and images, are taken from, unless specified, [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

The specialization comprises of 5 consecutive courses (except for the 3th course Structuring Machine Learning Projects, which could be taken separately) that covers from the most basic fundamental block of Deep Learning, including Perceptron, Unit, Single hidden layer to the state-of-the-art models for performing Classification and Image Recognition, NLP, etc.
- Course 1: [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning)
- Course 2: [Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network?specialization=deep-learning)
- Course 3: [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-projects?specialization=deep-learning)
- Course 4: [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning)
- Course 5: [Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nlp-sequence-models)

### My words
Below, you could find the notebooks which are the programming assignments for all courses in the specialization. But, please try to think how to solve it yourself before coming to seeing the solution. In that way, you actually learn a lot by yourself. I have come across different tutorials / courses about Deep Learning, and this specialization I would say is the best in building the knowledge from the bottom-up way, and the assignment is increasingly harder after each week / course, but if you follow and actually emphasize your learning, it is not too difficult to solve it. I have put the solution here, so if you are really stuck at some points, this might save you some time from banging your head against the wall / computer screen.
